# Voice-Powered-Note-Taking-Application
This project is a Voice-Powered Note-Taking Application built with Python, which allows you to speak your notes, move to the next line with a voice command, and automatically save them when you say "stop." It leverages speech recognition for converting spoken words into text and text-to-speech (TTS) for giving real-time feedback to the user.
